Baseline and Best Model Results:
--------------
For the Baseline Model with PyTorch, see the file: 05c.PyTorchBaseline.ipynb
For the Best performing models, CNN model with PyTorch, see the file 28.PyTorchCNN07.ipynb

* Note: PyTorch models make use of custom data files, images_main.csv and images_extra.csv, which are included


Other Model Results:
--------------
For the Tensorflow NN with greyscaling and data augmentation, see the file: COSC2793_A2_Tensorflow_Cancerous.ipynb
For Cell Type Modelling with Semi-Supervised Learning, see the file: 31.PyTorchFullDataMulti01.ipynb


Other Files:
------------
For Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) see the file: EDA.ipynb
For the Custom Main Images csv file that are pre-split by Train/Validation/Test, see the file: images_main.csv
	To regenerate the Custom Main images file, you can run the file: 02.ImageDataLoad.ipynb
