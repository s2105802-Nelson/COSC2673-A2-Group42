EDA
---

1) EDA on image files
2) EDA on Main Label files
3) EDA on the Extra Label files
4) Join of Image to Label data and EDA on the Join

Define the Problem
---

1) Clarify the problems - Binary Classification of Cancerous + Multi classification of Cancer type
2) Define our objective function and evaluation metric - Confusion Matrix + pick a good performance measure (accuracy, precision, specificity or other)
3) Deine a Hypothesis for each problem


Baseline Model
---

0) Run and understand the Week09_QandA notebook on tensorflow (face orientation problem)
1) Pick an algorithm / library  - Research, what is the most basic method for image classification?
2) Using just the image data, no hyperparameter tuning, no feature transformation stuff
3) Train Test Validation Split
4) Train a baseline model and get a result according to evaluation metric


Data Preparation / Feature Selection
---

1) Feature Selection: consider whether we combine image data with other feature data from label files
2) Transformation like power, log etc
3) Scaling (MinMax or Standard Scaling)
4) Encoding for categoricals (On hot encoding etc)


More Modelling
---

1) More advanced algorithms - Deep Learning and Neural Networks
2) Hyperparameter tuning
3) Pruning things - dropout


Review and Research
---

1) Review Lecture content and ensure we have covered all topics, including evalutation methods, determining overfitting etc
2) Have to research existing work on the topic and compare our results to existing work
3) Review this plan and figure out if we need to do more things
