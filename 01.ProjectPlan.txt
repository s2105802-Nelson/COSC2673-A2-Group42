9/5 - Due 15/5
-----------

Base model generated with results
Possible next steps for a model
	- Improve model by complexity
		- More hidden layers
		- More neurons per layer
		- More data
	- Reduce overfitting with Regularization
		- L2
		- Dropout
		- Early Stopping
	
Advanced next Steps
	- Different models / Algorithms
		- CNNs with different Architectures
		- Fully Connected vs Sparse Connected?
		- Deep Learning
		- Other NN types - ANNs, RNNs
	- Semi Supervised learning
		- Use the Extra data for Is Cancerous (not SS)
		- Use the Extra data for Cell Type
	- More Data
		- Apply transformation (likely rotation) to images to expand data set
		
		
KH
--
Tensorflow model improvement
	- Get the results for comparison
Possible:
	- Experiment with more layers and neurons
	- Try L2 or Dropout or both for regularization
		
Nelson
------
PyT base model make the same as KH 
	- Do a 2 Layer experiment - done
	- Predict on Test data and use that for results and comparison - done
CNN Model improvement
	- Experiment with CNN layers - Convolutions or NN layers?
		- 2 layer
		- 3 layer
	- Regularization, Dropout
Semi-supervised learning
	- Pick best CNN and run Binary Model
	- Implement SS on the Multi model
		- Recalculate Means with extra data?

EDA
---

1) EDA on image files
2) EDA on Main Label files
3) EDA on the Extra Label files
4) Join of Image to Label data and EDA on the Join

Define the Problem
---

1) Clarify the problems - Binary Classification of Cancerous + Multi classification of Cancer type
2) Define our objective function and evaluation metric - Confusion Matrix + pick a good performance measure (accuracy, precision, specificity or other)
    - Performance Metric to use is the F1-Score, which is the "harmonic" mean of the precision and recall.
3) Deine a Hypothesis for each problem


Baseline Model
---

0) Run and understand the Week09_QandA notebook on tensorflow (face orientation problem)
0a) Figure out how to convert our image data into an ML format
1) Pick an algorithm / library  - Research, what is the most basic method for image classification? (Tensorflow and decision trees)
2) Using just the image data, no hyperparameter tuning, no feature transformation stuff, main Label only
3) Train Test Validation Split
4) Train a baseline model and get a result according to evaluation metric


Data Preparation / Feature Selection
---

1) Feature Selection: consider whether we combine image data with other feature data from label files
2) Transformation like power, log etc
3) Scaling (MinMax or Standard Scaling)
4) Encoding for categoricals (On hot encoding etc)
5) Using RGB format of the images vs converting to Black and White


More Modelling
---

1) More advanced algorithms - Deep Learning and Neural Networks
2) Hyperparameter tuning
3) Pruning things - dropout
4) Examine the Extra Label and this additional problem
5) Semi-Supervised Learning, because Extra label has missing data - research and apply


Review and Research
---

1) Review Lecture content and ensure we have covered all topics, including evalutation methods, determining overfitting etc
2) Have to research existing work on the topic and compare our results to existing work
3) Review this plan and figure out if we need to do more things
